# SocialHound<br>The Social Network for Your Dog!

Social Hound is the 1st social media platform made just for your pup. Use the sign-up form to get started and once signed-in, you'll be able to create your pup's profile, find friend's location and posts, set-up play dates, and search for places you and your pup can enjoy together!<br  /><br  />Socialization is one of the most important things you can do for your dog.

## Summary

SocialHound is a true social media platform for your dog (and you!). Once signed in, you'll be able to create a profile, search for friends in your area, schedule play dates, and message your 'furends'.

Use our custom map tools to find dog parks, view boarding & daycare locations and locate vets in your area! There is also a map for finding new friends. View SocialHound pups in you area and schedule a date in the click of a button. Search by breed, size, and temperament.

Post your photos, videos and memories to your feed so your friends can view, like and comment on your dogs content! Post directly to your other pages on Twitter and Facebook!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
